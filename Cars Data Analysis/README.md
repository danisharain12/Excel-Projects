# Cars Dataset Analysis
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a cars dataset using Excel, applying advanced functions such as VLOOKUP, IF conditions, text parsing, and dynamic calculations to extract insights from the data.

## Tasks & Approaches
üìå Task 1: Data Integration & Cleaning
‚úî VLOOKUP: Merged data from different sheets, importing essential columns (Fuel, Registration City, Assembly, etc.).
‚úî Conditional Logic: Used IF(), AND(), OR(), and NOT() to create a "Selection" column for filtering cars based on criteria.
‚úî Text Parsing: Extracted car model names from the "Make Model" column using functions like FIND(), RIGHT(), and LEN().

üìå Task 2: Dynamic Calculations
‚úî Miles Per Year Calculation:

Converted kilometers to miles.
Divided by the difference between the car year and 2024.
Rounded values to 3 decimal places for accuracy.
Tools Used
Microsoft Excel (VLOOKUP, Conditional Formatting, Text Functions, Advanced Calculations)

## Data Cleaning & Manipulation
How to Use
1Ô∏è‚É£ Open the Excel file to explore data and formulas.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Check the VLOOKUP & Text Parsing sheets for integrated data.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Use filters to explore cars based on conditions.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Modify the "Miles Per Year" column for different calculations.

## Future Enhancements
Automating calculations using Power Query.
Performing advanced statistical analysis.
Visualizing trends with Excel charts & Power BI.
